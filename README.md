# SNN_MNIST Objectif
## 1 - Codding a simple mnist snn in python using tensorflow.
Comment almost all the line (75 percents)
Have at least 85 percent
Make a test suit and test hyperparemeter

## 2 - Compare speed with a normal MNSIT with no convolutino layers and no gpu
Create the same Model in C by using my matrice librairy

# Write what I learn
On notion put your code and explain every line
Do a README valueable
Make a `comparative` study with different hyperparameter

# Change the backpropagation
Try to change the backpropagtion function for reproduce the same \
as the heaveside function
